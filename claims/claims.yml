- id: CLM-0001
  statement: AdEx predicts 96% of spikes within ±2 ms compared to a conductance-based
    Hodgkin–Huxley model.
  status: PROVEN
  tier: A
  normative: true
  source: Brette & Gerstner (2005) J Neurophysiol 94:3637–3642
  locator: Abstract + results summary near p.3637 (verify exact sentence in paper
    PDF)
  action: KEEP
  notes: 'Use exact phrasing: 96% within ±2 ms (not ''±2 ms always'').'
- id: CLM-0003
  statement: NMDA Mg²⁺ block uses B(V)=1/(1+[Mg]/3.57*exp(-0.062*V)) with [Mg] in
    mM and V in mV.
  status: PROVEN
  tier: A
  normative: true
  source: Jahr & Stevens (1990) J Neurosci 10(9):3178–3182
  locator: Equation for Mg block coefficients (3.57 mM, -0.062 mV⁻¹), DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.10-09-03178.1990
  action: KEEP
  notes: Ensure units are stated explicitly.
- id: CLM-0099
  statement: STREAM achieves 100% on DVS Gesture (10-class).
  status: UNPROVEN
  tier: B
  normative: false
  source: Unresolved
  locator: No identifiable primary paper
  action: REMOVE
  notes: Remove from benchmark tables unless a primary source is added.
- id: CLM-0015
  statement: Reciprocal altruism can be favored by natural selection when interactions
    are repeated and contingent on observed outcomes.
  status: PROVEN
  tier: A
  normative: true
  source: Trivers (1971) The Quarterly Review of Biology 46(1):35–57
  locator: DOI:10.1086/406755
  action: KEEP
  notes: Use as biological foundation for result-based reciprocity gating.
- id: CLM-0016
  statement: In iterated dilemmas, contingent reciprocity strategies (e.g., tit-for-tat)
    can stabilize cooperation under suitable conditions.
  status: PROVEN
  tier: A
  normative: true
  source: Axelrod & Hamilton (1981) Science 211(4489):1390–1396
  locator: DOI:10.1126/science.7466396
  action: KEEP
  notes: Use as algorithmic justification for symmetric response to prior outcomes.
- id: CLM-0017
  statement: Indirect reciprocity based on reputation (image scoring) can promote
    cooperation without repeated pairwise encounters.
  status: PROVEN
  tier: A
  normative: true
  source: Nowak & Sigmund (1998) Nature 393(6685):573–577
  locator: DOI:10.1038/31225
  action: KEEP
  notes: Use for group-level 'social verification' via public outcome signals.
- id: CLM-0018
  statement: Costly sanctioning (altruistic punishment) can sustain cooperation in
    human groups and suppress free-riding.
  status: PROVEN
  tier: A
  normative: true
  source: Fehr & Gächter (2002) Nature 415(6868):137–140
  locator: DOI:10.1038/415137a
  action: KEEP
  notes: Use to justify resource withdrawal / sanction analogs as cooperation stabilizers.
