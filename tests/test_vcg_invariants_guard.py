Guard tests for VCG invariants defined in docs/VCG.md

These tests enforce the hard invariants specified for the Verified Contribution Gating module:
- I1: Support scores are deterministic given same observable log + parameters
- I2: Support score is monotonic non-increasing while contribution < threshold
- I3: Recovery is possible (no permanent exclusion) if contribution >= threshold
- I4: VCG remains side-effect free on the simulation core
