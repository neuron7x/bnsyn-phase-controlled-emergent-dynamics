# Task A Evidence — Unique description synchronization

- Source table line: `docs/SCRIPTS/index.md` now keeps the scanner phrase only for `scan_placeholders.py`.
- Section purpose lines were synchronized from per-script pages in `docs/scripts/*.md`.
- Duplicate generic phrase count in `docs/SCRIPTS/index.md` reduced to the scanner table row + scanner section purpose only.
