# Project Operating Contract for Agents
## Mission & Non-Goals
- Mission: complete pseudo-structures into real implementations, maintain intended behavior.
- Non-Goals: feature expansion, refactors beyond necessity, style rewrites, dependency churn.

## Repo Truth Sources (Priority Order)
1) Existing architecture docs (docs/**, ADRs, README)
2) Source code contracts/types (src/**, schemas)
3) Tests
4) CI configs
5) Issues/PR description (if present)

## Definition of “Pseudo-structure”
- Any placeholder that suggests intended capability but is not implemented or is non-functional:
  TODO/FIXME/WIP, NotImplementedError, stub returns, mocked production paths, empty handlers, “pass”, placeholder configs, fake data pipelines, skeleton modules without integration, unhooked CLI commands, dead code behind flags with no path.

## Allowed Changes
- Implement missing logic within intended modules only.
- Add/adjust tests to validate implementations.
- Minimal doc updates required for comprehension.
- Minimal config fixes needed to run checks.

## Forbidden Changes
- Changing product logic/requirements.
- Large-scale rewrites, renaming sprees, style-only diffs.
- Introducing new external services without explicit repo precedent.
- Disabling tests/linters/typechecks.

## Tooling & Commands (Project-Specific)
- Tests: `python -m pytest -m "not validation" -q` (Makefile `test`, used by CI reusable pytest workflows)
- Linters: `ruff check .` and `pylint src/bnsyn` (Makefile `lint`)
- Typechecks: `mypy src --strict --config-file pyproject.toml` (Makefile `mypy`)
- Build: `python -m build` (CI workflow `ci-pr-atomic.yml`)

## Evidence & Logging Standard
- All commands must be logged under proof_bundle/logs/.
- All key findings must have evidence pointers (file:line, or cmd log).
- No evidence => treat as unknown and do not claim.

## Human-in-the-loop Review Points
- Before first major implementation batch
- Before final PR ready claim
