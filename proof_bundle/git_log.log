    Add evidence-backed codebase readiness report and proof bundle
    
    ### Motivation
    - Provide a canonical Root Repo Representator (R0–R12) and an evidence-backed readiness score to drive production hardening and triage work.
    - Capture deterministic, auditable proof (command logs + file excerpts + hashes) so every non-zero assessment has traceable evidence.
    
    ### Description
    - Add `readiness_report.json` containing the representator (inventory, languages, dependencies, entrypoints, architecture, data model, API contracts, security, observability, release ops, lovable→prod delta), rubric scoring (0–100) and prioritized blockers/next actions.
    - Add `readiness_summary.md` (≤100 words) with the computed readiness %, level, confidence, and the top 5 blockers for quick consumption.
    - Add `proof_bundle/` with captured command logs (`python --version`, `pip --version`, `pytest --version`, `uname`, `lscpu`, `free -h`, `find`, `ext_counts`, attempted `python -m build`, attempted `pytest`), a `commands_index.json` with SHA256s, and a short `file_excerpts.md` to link evidence to score rationale.
    - This change is documentation/audit-only and does not modify production source code or tests.
    
    ### Testing
    - Collected environment and inventory evidence by running `python --version`, `python -m pip --version`, `python -m pytest --version`, `uname -a`, `lscpu`, `free -h`, and `find` and recorded their logs (all succeeded).
    - Attempted build with `python -m build` and recorded a failing log (`No module named build`), preserving fail-closed behavior.
    - Attempted unit/test run `python -m pytest -m "not validation" -q` and recorded collection failures due to missing local dependencies (e.g. `hypothesis`, `pyyaml`, `psutil`), and included the full test-collection log in the proof bundle.
    - Verified produced artifacts with `jq` and `wc` checks to confirm `readiness_report.json` and `readiness_summary.md` were generated and referenced by the `proof_bundle` index.
