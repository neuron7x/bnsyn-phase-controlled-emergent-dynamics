# Executive Summary

Executive Risk Index: **61/100**; Security Maturity Level: **L2 (Basic controls)**. Decision: **NO_GO** until high-priority trust-boundary controls are remediated. Primary risks are (1) CI supply-chain exposure from workflow trust crossings and (2) secrets hygiene drift indicated by pattern scans. Confidence is moderate-low (0.48) because M3/M6/M10 remain evidence-sparse and were fail-closed to UNKNOWN. Top mitigations with highest ROI are immutable SHA pinning for CI actions, branch-protection + workflow approvals, and automated secret scanning with rotation playbooks. Estimated hardening timeline is 2–4 weeks with 2–3 FTE if workstreams run in parallel. Residual uncertainty is 57/100; additional runtime and tenancy evidence is required to reduce posterior risk. Economic impact is evidence-limited: current band assessed as Medium with assumptions clearly labeled.
