# Roadmap

This roadmap summarizes currently tracked work from repository planning artifacts.

## Priority source

- Structured priorities: [worklist.json](worklist.json)
- Batch plan and command contracts: [plan.md](plan.md)

## Current focus areas

### Runtime-critical
- `PH-0001` from `worklist.json` priority group `runtime_critical`.

### Test-focused
- `PH-0002` and `PH-0003` from `worklist.json` priority group `tests`.

## Execution framing

`plan.md` defines closure batches for the active placeholder set and records canonical scan/test commands used to verify closure.

## Update model

Roadmap updates track changes to `worklist.json` and `plan.md`; this page is a descriptive summary of those files.
