goals:
  - Produce implementation-evidence artifacts required by the execution-engineer system prompt.
  - Capture reproducible verification evidence from this repository state.
constraints:
  - Keep code behavior unchanged; documentation/evidence-only patch.
  - Fail-closed reporting: mark unresolved checks as FAIL/UNKNOWN.
  - Use repository-native commands and deterministic logs.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Required deliverables exist: IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, CHANGESET_PLAN.yaml, VERIFICATION_REPORT.md, PR_READY_CHECKLIST.md, PROOF_BUNDLE/.
  - Verification logs include exact command, timeout, exit code, and log path.
  - Toolchain fingerprint and reproducibility audit hash are generated.
assumptions:
  - No feature diff/PR ref was supplied; task is interpreted as execution/readiness evidence generation.
  - Existing lint failures outside this patch are pre-existing and reported, not silently fixed.
tasks:
  - id: T1
    description: Capture repo identity, toolchain, lockfile hashes, and baseline commands.
    risk: low
    rollback: Remove PROOF_BUNDLE artifacts.
  - id: T2
    description: Run verification gates (lint, tests, type-check, build, security-tool discovery) and store logs.
    risk: medium
    rollback: None needed (read-only execution).
  - id: T3
    description: Write mandatory artifacts (summary/verification/checklist) with explicit PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN.
    risk: low
    rollback: Revert artifact files.
