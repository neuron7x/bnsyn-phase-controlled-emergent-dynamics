# Decision Log

- 2026-02-18: Created initial LPRO proof-bundle skeleton and executed baseline repro gates without product-code changes. Rationale: establish deterministic evidence baseline before remediation.
- 2026-02-18: Marked supply-chain/security gates as UNKNOWN instead of PASS because no SBOM/vulnerability scan evidence was captured in this batch (fail-closed policy).
