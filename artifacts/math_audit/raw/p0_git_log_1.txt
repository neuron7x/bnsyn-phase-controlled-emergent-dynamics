    Calibrate audit evidence and finalize merge-ready valuation report
    
    ### Motivation
    - Produce an updated, evidence-bound valuation report that matches the repository's current state and is merge-ready.
    - Ensure deterministic, reproducible aggregates and arithmetic reconciliation between the narrative report and machine-readable inputs.
    - Surface CI/CD, test, complexity and inventory evidence so figures survive audit and cross-examination.
    
    ### Description
    - Added `REPO_WORK_ASSESSMENT_VALUATION.md` containing the reconciled valuation narrative, convergence binding, dual framing, and final monetary ranges.
    - Persisted deterministic evidence under `audit_evidence/` (notably `00_index.txt`, `01_metadata.txt`, `02_contributors.txt`, `03_file_inventory.txt`, `04_loc.txt`, `05_tests.txt`, `06_cicd.txt`, `07_complexity.txt`, `08_churn.txt`, `09_velocity.txt`, `10_doc_sizes.txt`, `11_function_points.txt`, and phase1/phase3 probes).
    - Added `audit_report_data.json` with category totals, `countable_totals`, `core_logic_sublevels`, and `documentation_depth` to drive the report and enable programmatic reconciliation.
    - Calibrated CI/CD discovery and complexity outputs (radon) and reconciled generated / countable file splits; changes committed and prepared for PR.
    
    ### Testing
    - Ran `python -m json.tool audit_report_data.json` to validate JSON syntax (status: OK).
    - Executed reconciliation assertions via a short `python` assertion script that verifies files/code totals and inventory split (status: `RECON_OK`).
    - Collected complexity evidence with `radon cc` and persisted results to `audit_evidence/07_complexity.txt` (status: OK).
    - Verified test inventory, CI/CD discovery (`find`), and LOC fallback outputs via the recorded `audit_evidence/*` files; `cloc` was unavailable so a labeled `wc -l` fallback was used and recorded (fallback executed and recorded).
