# Positioning

## One-liner
BN-Syn is a deterministic, research-grade CLI toolkit for phase-controlled emergent dynamics experiments.

## Why us
- Determinism and governance artifacts are first-class.
- Built-in simulation + reproducibility workflow in one repo.
- Extensive documentation and traceability structure.

## Differentiators (Top 3)
1. Strong evidence-driven governance and SSOT orientation.
2. Integrated criticality/sleep-stack simulation primitives.
3. Explicit CI/readiness tooling for scientific reproducibility.

## Risks
- Product positioning remains research-centric rather than broad consumer SaaS.
