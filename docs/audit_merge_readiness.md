# Audit Merge Readiness Report

This report validates the documentation formalization PR against merge gates A–G.

## Gate Status

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| A — Repository State & Scope Integrity | PASS | Doc-only changed files in current diff (`docs/`, `scripts/README.md`, `DOC_CHANGELOG.md`, `proof_bundle/*`). |
| B — Documentation Coverage Completeness | PASS | Script docs coverage is 64/64 with no missing pages. |
| C — Link Integrity & Navigation | PASS | Root docs toctree links navigation pages and scripts/contracts sections; docs build succeeds. |
| D — Claim Veracity & Evidence Density | PASS | Unsupported/uncertain script behavior remains labeled `UNKNOWN/TBD`; contradiction note retained in changelog. |
| E — Docs Build & Determinism | PASS | `make docs` exits 0 and generates HTML in `docs/_build/html`. |
| F — Proof Bundle Validity | PASS | `proof_bundle/` includes commands, inventory, repo state, and current SHA256 manifest. |
| G — PR Hygiene | PASS | `DOC_CHANGELOG.md` includes explicit docs-only statement and meta-audit notes. |

## Fixed Issues in This Pass

1. **Standardized script page template heading to required plural section name.**
   - Fixed `## Example Invocation` → `## Examples` across all `docs/scripts/*.md` pages.
2. **Added explicit merge-readiness audit artifact.**
   - Added this file (`docs/audit_merge_readiness.md`) with gate-by-gate PASS table.
3. **Regenerated proof bundle for coherence and strict logging schema.**
   - `proof_bundle/commands.log` now records timestamp, cwd, command, timeout, duration, exit, stdout, stderr for each executed command.
   - `proof_bundle/doc_inventory.json` and `proof_bundle/hashes.sha256` refreshed to match current repository state.

## Remaining UNKNOWN/TBD

- Some scripts have no module docstring or no explicit output path literals; those script pages remain marked `UNKNOWN/TBD` intentionally to avoid unsupported claims.
- Sphinx emits non-fatal warnings from existing documentation corpus; build is successful and warnings are captured in proof logs.

## Final Statement

**Docs-only; merge-ready.**
