# Mathematical Artifact Provenance

## Reproduction entrypoint

```bash
python scripts/generate_math_data.py
```

## Provenance classes

- `SOURCED`: version-controlled source artifacts (`src/`) with direct Git provenance.
- `PARTIAL`: generator script is known, but runtime profile/seed metadata is incomplete.
- `UNTRUSTED`: no deterministic generator metadata was discovered in-repo.

## Deterministic context

Phase-0 environment snapshot is stored at `artifacts/math_audit/baseline_env.txt`.

## Known provenance gaps

- `results/` artifacts currently lack generator command + fixed seed records and remain `UNTRUSTED`.
- benchmark baseline JSON files are generated by benchmark scripts, but scenario/seed parameters are not fully pinned inside artifact metadata.
