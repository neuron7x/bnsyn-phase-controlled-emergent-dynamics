# Gate failure
- failing gate: make mypy
- first failing error excerpt (verbatim):
```
src/bnsyn/web/config.py:79: error: Argument "environment" to "Settings" has incompatible type "str"; expected "Literal['dev', 'prod', 'test']"  [arg-type]
```
- minimal fix plan:
  1. Cast parsed environment string to Literal type after runtime validation.
  2. Re-run make mypy.
