# Baseline gate failure
- failing gate: make lint
- first failing error excerpt (verbatim):
```
************* Module bnsyn
src/bnsyn/__init__.py:32:0: C0301: Line too long (127/100) (line-too-long)
```
- minimal fix plan:
  1. Keep global pre-existing lint debt unchanged (outside requested security perimeter scope).
  2. Implement web security perimeter files and ensure all newly touched files pass lint/mypy/tests.
  3. Re-run required gates and capture outcomes.
