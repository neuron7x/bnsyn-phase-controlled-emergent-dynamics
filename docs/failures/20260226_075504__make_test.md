# Gate failure
- failing gate: make test
- first failing error excerpt (verbatim):
```
FAILED tests/test_generate_inventory.py::test_inventory_json_matches_repository_state
```
- minimal fix steps:
  1. Regenerate INVENTORY.json to include newly added source/test/docs files.
  2. This requires editing INVENTORY.json, which is outside the allowed project boundaries for this task.
  3. Keep feature changes limited to allowed files and report this boundary blocker.
