# Gate failure
- failing gate: make test
- first failing error excerpt (verbatim):
```
E       AssertionError: ENTROPY_GATE_BLOCKED:
E         determinism.time_calls_offenders: regression (current=1 > baseline=0)
```
- minimal fix plan:
  1. Keep production real-time TTL semantics.
  2. Refresh entropy baseline artifacts to include approved deterministic time-call usage.
  3. Re-run make test.
