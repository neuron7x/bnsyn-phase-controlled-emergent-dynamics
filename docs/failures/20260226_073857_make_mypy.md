# Gate failure
- failing gate: make mypy
- first failing error excerpt (verbatim):
```
src/bnsyn/web/security.py:9: error: Library stubs not installed for "passlib.context"  [import-untyped]
```
- minimal fix plan:
  1. Add explicit mypy-safe typing shims/casts in web modules.
  2. Re-run make mypy.
