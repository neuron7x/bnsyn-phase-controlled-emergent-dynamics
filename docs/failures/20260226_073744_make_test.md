# Gate failure
- failing gate: make test
- first failing error excerpt (verbatim):
```

```
- minimal fix plan:
  1. Entropy baseline/policy must be updated to account for new security-perimeter files.
  2. This requires edits under entropy/ (outside allowlist), so cannot be completed within current scope constraints.
