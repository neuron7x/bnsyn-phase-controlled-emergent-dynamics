Missing productization layers captured for status coherence with `README.md` and `docs/STATUS.md` (see path/README.md) (see path/docs/STATUS.md).

- SRE runbooks under SLA
- external integration contracts
- stabilized public API/semver as product
- perf budgets as “must”
- support/release cadence as product
