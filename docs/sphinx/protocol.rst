Protocol References
===================

Key protocol references live in the repository documentation set:

- Determinism and execution protocol: `docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md <../../docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md>`_
- Core system protocol/specification: `docs/SPEC.md <../../docs/SPEC.md>`_
- Criticality control protocol: `docs/CRITICALITY_CONTROL_VS_MEASUREMENT.md <../../docs/CRITICALITY_CONTROL_VS_MEASUREMENT.md>`_

These files are the canonical sources for operational and experimental protocols.
