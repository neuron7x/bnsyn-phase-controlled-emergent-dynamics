## Historical Findings (Resolved)

### FND-0001 (RESOLVED)
- **Symptom:** `scripts/validate_bibliography.py` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`.
- **Root cause:** `PyYAML` dependency not installed in the execution environment.
- **Anchors:** `scripts/validate_bibliography.py:17` (import `yaml`).
- **Fix:** `PyYAML` added to `[dev]` dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved — validator runs successfully.

### FND-0002 (RESOLVED)
- **Symptom:** `pytest -m "not validation"` fails during test collection with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bnsyn'` across multiple tests.
- **Root cause:** Python package not installed or import path not configured for tests.
- **Anchors:** `tests/test_*` imports, e.g., `tests/test_adex_smoke.py:2`.
- **Fix:** Install package via `pip install -e ".[dev]"` before running tests. CI workflows already do this.
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved — tests collect and run without import errors.

### FND-0003 (RESOLVED)
- **Symptom:** `pytest -m validation` fails during test collection with same `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bnsyn'`.
- **Root cause:** Same as FND-0002.
- **Anchors:** `tests/test_validation_largeN.py:2` and other test imports.
- **Fix:** Same as FND-0002.
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved — tests collect and run without import errors.

## Known Issues (Pre-existing)

### FND-0004 (PRE-EXISTING)
- **Symptom:** `test_adex_refractory_holds_reset` fails in validation tests.
- **Root cause:** Test expects spike at V0=-45mV with V_spike=-40mV threshold, but AdEx dynamics may not produce a spike within one dt=1e-4s (0.1ms) timestep.
- **Anchors:** `tests/validation/test_production_properties.py:29-33`
- **Status:** ⚠️ Pre-existing failure — not introduced by architecture changes.
- **Notes:** This is a test design issue in the production properties tests, not a core logic bug. The test is marked as `@pytest.mark.validation` and runs in the separate validation CI workflow.

## Architecture Findings (Phase 1)

### FND-0005 (ADDRESSED)
- **Symptom:** No single navigation hub for documentation.
- **Root cause:** Documentation scattered across multiple files without central index.
- **Fix:** Created `docs/INDEX.md` as single navigation hub.
- **Status:** ✅ Addressed

### FND-0006 (ADDRESSED)
- **Symptom:** No single-page governance entry.
- **Root cause:** Governance concepts split across SSOT.md, SSOT_RULES.md, NORMATIVE_LABELING.md without unified entry point.
- **Fix:** Created `docs/GOVERNANCE.md` as one-page governance entry linking all policies.
- **Status:** ✅ Addressed

### FND-0007 (ADDRESSED)
- **Symptom:** README not serving as effective system launchpad.
- **Root cause:** README missing test commands, missing links to governance, incomplete repo map.
- **Fix:** Updated README with repo map table, SSOT gate commands, test commands, and governance links.
- **Status:** ✅ Addressed

### FND-0008 (ADDRESSED)
- **Symptom:** Makefile missing standard targets.
- **Root cause:** Only `validate-claims`, `validate-bibliography`, `validate-all` existed.
- **Fix:** Added `ssot`, `test-smoke`, `test-validation`, `ci-local` targets.
- **Status:** ✅ Addressed
