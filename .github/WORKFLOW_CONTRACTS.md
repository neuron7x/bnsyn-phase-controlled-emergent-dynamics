# CI/CD Workflow Contracts

**Version:** 1.1
**Date (UTC):** 2026-02-03
**Repository:** neuron7x/bnsyn-phase-controlled-emergent-dynamics
**Total workflows:** 28
**Breakdown:** 17 primary + 11 reusable

## Axiom Dictionary

* **A1 — Determinism & Toolchain Pinning**
* **A2 — CI Correctness & Regression Safety**
* **A3 — Workflow Integrity & Provenance (branch/sha correctness, tamper resistance)**
* **A4 — Performance & Benchmark Fidelity**
* **A5 — Chaos / Robustness / Fault Injection**
* **A6 — Quality / Mutation / Adversarial Testing**
* **A7 — Formal Verification – Proof Assistants (e.g., Coq)**
* **A8 — Formal Verification – Temporal Logic / Model Checking (e.g., TLA)**
* **A9 — Security & Permissions Hygiene (least privilege, untrusted code boundaries)**

## Migration Notes (v1.1)

* Expanded axiom dictionary from prior legend to include A1–A9 with explicit names; all uses in this document map to the dictionary above.

## Global Notes

* Workflow-level timeouts are not supported in GitHub Actions; only job-level `timeout-minutes` are recorded.
* Timeout notation: use **Not set** when `timeout-minutes` is absent in the workflow YAML.
* Branch protection rules are defined in **PR-Gate Definition (Authoritative)**.
* This contract is normative even if current branch protection temporarily deviates.

## PR-Gate Definition (Authoritative)

* Required PR checks are defined in `.github/PR_GATES.yml`; this document MUST match it.
* Required PR-gates MUST be: `ci-pr-atomic.yml`, `workflow-integrity.yml`.
* Required checks MUST NOT include any workflow other than the PR-gates listed above.
* If any other section conflicts with this, this section wins.

## Required PR Gates

The workflows below are the required PR gates that must pass on pull requests. Source: `.github/PR_GATES.yml`.

| Workflow File | Workflow Name | Required Job IDs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci-pr-atomic.yml` | `ci-pr-atomic` | `gate-profile`, `determinism`, `quality`, `build`, `tests-smoke`, `ssot`, `security`, `finalize` |
| `workflow-integrity.yml` | `Workflow Integrity` | `validate-workflows` |

## Gate Class Policy (Normative)

* PR-gate workflows MAY be required checks.
* Long-running workflows MUST NOT be required checks and MUST NOT block merge.
* If a workflow is not explicitly labeled PR-gate, it MUST NOT be required in branch protection.
* EXCEPTION format (only when a PR-gate lacks `pull_request`): `EXCEPTION: <workflow file> - <reason>` on the line immediately following the workflow row in the inventory table.

## Workflow Policy Rules (Auto-generated)

| Rule ID | Statement | Enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Workflows with Gate Class `long-running` MUST NOT declare `push` or `pull_request` triggers. | `python -m scripts.validate_long_running_triggers` (exit 0 OK, exit 2 violations, exit 3 parse errors). |
| R2 | Long-running workflows MUST use only the allowed trigger sets: non-reusable `{schedule, workflow_dispatch}`; reusable `{workflow_call}` or `{workflow_call, workflow_dispatch}` with `workflow_call` required. | `python -m scripts.validate_long_running_triggers` (exit 0 OK, exit 2 violations, exit 3 parse errors). |
| R3 | Workflows named `_reusable_*.yml` MUST declare `on: workflow_call` only. | `python -m scripts.validate_long_running_triggers` (exit 0 OK, exit 2 violations, exit 3 parse errors). |
| R4 | Workflows with Gate Class `PR-gate` MUST include `pull_request` unless an explicit `EXCEPTION:` line is present in the inventory table. | `python -m scripts.validate_long_running_triggers` (exit 0 OK, exit 2 violations, exit 3 parse errors). |

## science.yml

**Path:** `.github/workflows/science.yml`
**Status:** Active

**Gate Class:** long-running

**Gate Rationale:**

* Non-PR gate; must not run on pull_request/push.

* Scheduled flagship experiments support A2 scientific validation without gating PR merges.

**Intent (1–2 sentences):**

* Execute a flagship experiment workflow to validate scientific hypotheses with artifacts via the reusable formal/science template.

**Axiom focus:**

* A2 — CI Correctness & Regression Safety

**Owner:**

* @neuron7x

**Trigger(s):**

* `workflow_dispatch`.
* `schedule` (weekly Sunday 00:00 UTC).

**Timeout(s):**

* `flagship-experiment`: 30

**Jobs:**

* `flagship-experiment` — Runs experiment, visualizes results, verifies hypothesis, uploads artifacts.

**Delegation & provenance:**

* Delegates execution to `_reusable_formal_science.yml` with `proof-suite=science`, `model-set=temp_ablation_v2`, `time-budget=30`.
* Critical outputs: `experiment-results` and `experiment-figures` artifacts plus summary manifest in the job summary.

**Evidence:**

* `./workflows/science.yml`

## workflow-integrity.yml

**Path:** `.github/workflows/workflow-integrity.yml`
**Status:** Active

**Gate Class:** PR-gate

**Gate Rationale:**

* Required PR gate enforcing A3/A9 workflow integrity and permissions hygiene before merge.

**Intent (1–2 sentences):**

* Lint and validate workflow files for integrity, encoding safety, and safety artifacts.

**Axiom focus:**

* A3 — Workflow Integrity & Provenance
* A9 — Security & Permissions Hygiene

**Trigger(s):**

* `pull_request` (branches: `main`).
* `push` (branches: `main`).

**Timeout(s):**

* `validate-workflows`: 5

**Jobs:**

* `validate-workflows` — Enforces non-PR workflow trigger policy, runs actionlint, scans workflows/docs for control or tab characters (and non-ASCII in workflow YAML), validates safety artifacts, and checks inventory drift.

**Evidence:**

* `./workflows/workflow-integrity.yml`

## Redundancy & Consolidation

1. **ci-smoke.yml vs ci-pr-atomic.yml** (Candidate for consolidation)
   * Rationale: `ci-smoke.yml` and `ci-pr-atomic.yml` share `push` (main) and `pull_request` triggers, and `ci-smoke` job set (`ssot`, `tests-smoke`) overlaps with `ci-pr-atomic` which already runs SSOT and smoke tests via reusable workflow. `ci-pr.yml` is now a wrapper and no longer a target for consolidation.
   * Safe target: `ci-pr-atomic.yml` as SSOT.
   * Removal criteria: REQUIRES branch protection to require only PR-gate workflows (`ci-pr-atomic.yml`, `workflow-integrity.yml`) and remove `ci-smoke.yml`; REQUIRES `ci-pr-atomic.yml` smoke + SSOT checks to be equivalent for at least 2 weeks; REQUIRES no downstream integrations to rely on `ci-smoke.yml` status checks.
   * Risks: Branch protection or external status check dependencies could block merges; mitigate by updating protection rules and notifying integrators.
   * Evidence: `./workflows/ci-smoke.yml`, `./workflows/ci-pr-atomic.yml`

2. **ci-validation.yml (mode orchestration)** (Consolidation completed)
   * Rationale: Validation, property, and chaos suites are orchestrated via a single workflow with mode routing.
   * Current state: `ci-validation.yml` routes standard/elite/chaos schedules and dispatch inputs to reusable jobs.
   * Follow-up criteria: MUST ensure branch protection requires only PR-gate workflows (`ci-pr-atomic.yml`, `workflow-integrity.yml`) and not `ci-validation`; SHOULD ensure scheduled cadence matches prior weekly/daily runs.
   * Evidence: `./workflows/ci-validation.yml`, `./workflows/_reusable_ssot.yml`, `./workflows/_reusable_validation_tests.yml`, `./workflows/_reusable_property_tests.yml`, `./workflows/_reusable_chaos_tests.yml`

3. **ci-validation.yml (property mode)** (Consolidation completed)
   * Rationale: Property tests are now scheduled and dispatched via `ci-validation.yml` with a dedicated `property` mode.
   * Current state: `ci-validation.yml` owns the 02:30 UTC property schedule and `workflow_dispatch` supports `mode=property`.
   * Follow-up criteria: SHOULD ensure property mode cadence and profile alignment with `ci` expectations.
   * Evidence: `./workflows/ci-validation.yml`, `./workflows/_reusable_property_tests.yml`

4. **benchmarks.yml vs ci-benchmarks-elite.yml vs ci-benchmarks.yml** (Consolidation in progress)
   * Rationale: Benchmark execution is centralized in `_reusable_benchmarks.yml`, with `ci-benchmarks.yml` as the canonical entrypoint.
   * Current state: `benchmarks.yml` and `ci-benchmarks-elite.yml` are compatibility shims delegating directly to `_reusable_benchmarks.yml`.
   * Removal criteria: REQUIRES branch protection to require only PR-gate workflows (`ci-pr-atomic.yml`, `workflow-integrity.yml`) and downstream dependencies updated; REQUIRES legacy schedules to be retired or migrated without duplicate runs.
   * Risks: Duplicate benchmark runs while shims remain; mitigate by removing shims after protection verification.
   * Evidence: `./workflows/_reusable_benchmarks.yml`, `./workflows/benchmarks.yml`, `./workflows/ci-benchmarks-elite.yml`, `./workflows/ci-benchmarks.yml`
